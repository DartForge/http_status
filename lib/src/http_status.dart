/// Each [HttpStatusCode] is described below, including a description of which
/// method(s) it can follow and any metainformation required in the response.
///
/// * __Informational 1xx__
///
///   This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting
///   only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an
///   empty line. There are no required headers for this class of status code.
///   Since __HTTP/1.0__ did not define any __1xx__ status codes, servers
///   __MUST NOT__ send a __1xx__ response to an __HTTP/1.0__ client except
///   under experimental conditions.
///
///   A client __MUST__ be prepared to accept one or more __1xx__ status
///   responses prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect
///   a __100__ (Continue) status message. Unexpected __1xx__ status responses
///   __MAY__ be ignored by a user agent.
///
///   Proxies __MUST__ forward __1xx__ responses, unless the connection between
///   the proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself
///   requested the generation of the __1xx__ response. (For example, if a proxy
///   adds a _"Expect: 100-continue"_ field when it forwards a request, then it
///   need not forward the corresponding __100__ (Continue) response(s).)
///
/// * __Successful 2xx__
///
///   This class of status code indicates that the client's request was
///   successfully received, understood, and accepted.
///
/// * __Redirection 3xx__
///
///   This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken
///   by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required
///   __MAY__ be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user
///   if and only if the method used in the second request is __GET__ or
///   __HEAD__. A client __SHOULD__ detect infinite redirection loops, since
///   such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.
///
///   > Note: previous versions of this specification recommended a maximum of
///     five redirections. Content developers should be aware that there might
///     be clients that implement such a fixed limitation.
///
/// * __Client Error 4xx__
///
///   The __4xx__ class of status code is intended for cases in which the client
///   seems to have erred. Except when responding to a __HEAD__ request, the
///   server __SHOULD__ include an entity containing an explanation of the error
///   situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These
///   status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents __SHOULD__
///   display any included entity to the user.
///
///   If the client is sending data, a server implementation using __TCP__
///   __SHOULD__ be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of
///   the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the input
///   connection. If the client continues sending data to the server after the
///   close, the server's __TCP__ stack will send a reset packet to the client,
///   which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers before they can
///   be read and interpreted by the __HTTP__ application.
///
/// * __Server Error 5xx__
///
///   Response status codes beginning with the digit _"5"_ indicate cases in
///   which the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of
///   performing the request. Except when responding to a __HEAD__ request,
///   the server __SHOULD__ include an entity containing an explanation of the
///   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition.
///   User agents __SHOULD__ display any included entity to the user.
///   These response codes are applicable to any request method.
